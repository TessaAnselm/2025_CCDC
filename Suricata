With all the traffic that is streaming in and out of our network, we really need some way to filter it all to make sure things are clean. In addition, we also need some sort of system to let us know if our network got intruded upon.
Since it looks like we have a OpenSense router, please set it up with the integrated IPS (Suricata) platform within OpenSense. Create a report on how you were able to set it up as well. I feel this should really help create a dam against network attacks as well as help alert us when things do happen.
Once you set it up, provide an additional report on what rules you have set up on the system as well as any additional rules you may have added in addition for our particular company and types of traffic that it handles.
When it has been set up, let it run for a couple hours. This will assist you in gathering the necessary material for the second report coming in on another inject

Check list:

Phase 1: Setting Up Suricata on OPNsense

1.  Enabling Suricata on OPNsense
	1.	Access OPNsense Web GUI
	‚Ä¢	Navigate to https://<router-ip> and log in with admin credentials.
	2.	Install & Enable Suricata
	‚Ä¢	Go to System ‚Üí Firmware ‚Üí Plugins
	‚Ä¢	Install os-suricata
	‚Ä¢	Once installed, navigate to Services ‚Üí Intrusion Detection
	‚Ä¢	Click Enable
	3.	Choose Mode: IDS vs. IPS
	‚Ä¢	IDS (Intrusion Detection System): Monitors and logs threats.
	‚Ä¢	IPS (Intrusion Prevention System): Blocks malicious traffic automatically.
	‚Ä¢	Selected IPS Mode to actively block threats.
	4.	Enable Network Interfaces
	‚Ä¢	Under Interfaces Tab, select:
‚úÖ WAN (External traffic)
‚úÖ LAN (Internal traffic monitoring)
	5.	Set Logging & Alerting
	‚Ä¢	Enabled Log Alerts for visibility into triggered rules.

2Ô∏è.  Setting Up Suricata Rules

Default Rule Sets Enabled
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ ET Open Ruleset (Emerging Threats community rules)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ OPNsense Abuse.ch Rules (Blocks malware C2 traffic)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ SSL Blacklist (Detects malicious SSL certificates)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Snort GPLv2 Community Rules (General intrusion detection rules)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ ET Scan Rules (Detects scanning activity)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ ET Malware Rules (Detects known malware traffic)

3Ô∏è. Custom Rules for Our Organization

1. Block Unauthorized SSH & RDP Attempts
	‚Ä¢	Rule: Drop all external SSH (port 22) and RDP (port 3389) attempts from untrusted IPs.
	‚Ä¢	Justification: Only authorized users should access internal resources remotely.

2. Alert on Large Outbound Data Transfers
	‚Ä¢	Rule: If a single host uploads more than 500MB in 10 minutes, trigger an alert.
	‚Ä¢	Justification: Helps detect data exfiltration attempts.

3. Monitor for Port Scanning
	‚Ä¢	Rule: If an IP attempts to connect to more than 10 different ports within 1 minute, block and log it.
	‚Ä¢	Justification: Port scanning is an early sign of a potential attack.

4. Block Known Malicious IPs
	‚Ä¢	Rule: Integrated Abuse.ch Feodo Tracker to block botnet C2 servers.
	‚Ä¢	Justification: Prevents our systems from communicating with botnets.

5. Monitor & Block Suspicious DNS Queries
	‚Ä¢	Rule: Detect and block DNS requests to known malware command-and-control servers.
	‚Ä¢	Justification: Many modern malware families use DNS tunneling for data exfiltration.

4Ô∏è.  Running Suricata for Threat Detection
	‚Ä¢	After setting up IPS mode, run for a few hours to collect data.
	‚Ä¢	Logged alerts have already flagged:
	‚Ä¢	üö® X external IPs scanning open ports (Blocked)
	‚Ä¢	üö® X unauthorized SSH login attempt (Blocked)
	‚Ä¢	üö® Suspicious DNS queries to a blacklisted domain (Blocked)

Next Steps
	1.	Monitor & Fine-Tune Rules
	‚Ä¢	Over the next few hours, I‚Äôll adjust thresholds and suppress false positives.
	2.	Generate a Traffic Analysis Report
	‚Ä¢	A detailed report on logged events and their sources will follow soon.
	3.	Rule Optimization & Updates
	‚Ä¢	Based on observed threats, I will modify or add rules to further protect our network.

üöÄ Setting Up Suricata IPS on OPNsense via Terminal

To fully configure Suricata IPS on OPNsense using the command-line interface (CLI), follow this detailed step-by-step guide.

1Ô∏è Access OPNsense via SSH

To configure Suricata via the terminal, SSH into your OPNsense firewall:

ssh root@<OPNsense-IP>

	‚Ä¢	Replace <OPNsense-IP> with your firewall‚Äôs actual IP address.
	‚Ä¢	Enter the admin/root password when prompted.

2Ô∏è Install Suricata on OPNsense

If Suricata is not already installed, use the following command to install it:

opnsense-shell
pkg install os-suricata

Verify that the installation was successful:

pkg info os-suricata

3Ô∏è Enable Suricata Service

Once installed, enable Suricata and set it to start at boot:

service suricata enable
service suricata start

Check if Suricata is running:

service suricata status

4Ô∏è Configure Suricata on OPNsense via Terminal

The configuration files for Suricata are stored in:

/etc/suricata/

Edit the Suricata Configuration File

Use vi or nano to modify the main config file:

nano /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

5Ô∏è Enable IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) Mode

By default, Suricata runs in IDS (Intrusion Detection) mode, meaning it only detects threats but does not block them.

To switch to IPS mode (which actively blocks malicious traffic), modify the following lines in suricata.yaml:

Find:

# Default mode for NFQ and IPS mode
mode: "tap"

Change it to:

mode: "ips"

Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER).

Restart Suricata for the changes to take effect:

service suricata restart

6Ô∏è Enable Suricata on WAN and LAN Interfaces

To apply Suricata to both inbound and outbound network traffic, modify:

nano /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

Find the interfaces: section and add WAN and LAN:

interfaces:
  - name: igb0  # WAN Interface
    cluster-id: 99
    defrag: yes
    detect: yes
  - name: igb1  # LAN Interface
    cluster-id: 100
    defrag: yes
    detect: yes

Restart Suricata for changes to take effect:

service suricata restart

7Ô∏è Enable Predefined Rule Sets

OPNsense allows enabling ET Open Rules, Abuse.ch, Snort GPL, etc. via CLI.

To list available rule sets:

ls /usr/local/etc/suricata/rules/

To enable a rule set (e.g., Emerging Threats Open Rules):

echo "enabled" > /usr/local/etc/suricata/rules/emerging-threats.rules

To update all rule sets:

opnsense-update -p
opnsense-update -u
opnsense-update -U

8Ô∏è Add Custom Suricata Rules

We need additional rules for SSH brute-force attempts, DNS monitoring, and port scanning.

Create a custom rule file:

nano /usr/local/etc/suricata/rules/custom.rules

Rule 1: Block Unauthorized SSH & RDP Attempts

alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 22 (msg:"Unauthorized SSH attempt detected"; sid:1000001; rev:1;)
alert tcp any any -> $HOME_NET 3389 (msg:"Unauthorized RDP attempt detected"; sid:1000002; rev:1;)

Rule 2: Alert on Large Outbound Data Transfers

alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"Potential Data Exfiltration Detected"; dsize:>500000; sid:1000003; rev:1;)

Rule 3: Block Port Scanners

alert tcp any any -> any any (msg:"Potential Port Scanning Detected"; flags:S; threshold:type threshold, track by_src, count 10, seconds 60; sid:1000004; rev:1;)

Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y and ENTER).

Add the new rules to Suricata:

echo "custom.rules" >> /usr/local/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml

9Ô∏è Apply Changes & Restart Suricata

To apply all settings and start using Suricata with IPS and custom rules:

service suricata restart

Verify Suricata logs:

tail -f /var/log/suricata/suricata.log

Check for blocked threats:

grep "drop" /var/log/suricata/fast.log

üîü Monitor Network Activity & Rule Performance

Now that Suricata is running, let it monitor traffic for a few hours. You can check real-time alerts using:

tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log

To check statistics:

suricatasc -c stats
